      <p><span class="highlight">Name:</span> <em>Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors: Part 1</em></p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Author:</span> GM Garry Kasparov, Six time World Chess Champion</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Rating:</span> 1000-2400+</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Theme:</span> Grandmaster Games, Detailed analysis</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Owner's Remarks:</span> This book covers Wilhelm Steinitz, Emanuel Lasker, José Raúl Capablanca, and Alexander Alekhine.
Kasparov does not merely annotate their games — he dissects them with surgical precision, offering modern analysis, historical commentary, and personal insights. </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">RECOMMENDED USE:</span>Use a physical chessboard to play through each annotated game. After every 2–3 moves, pause and reflect:

Why was this move played?

What were the alternatives?

What transformations are occurring in the position?

Which pieces will gain or lose value as the game transitions into the middlegame or endgame?
This method strengthens critical thinking and helps develop a historical chess intuition.</p>

      <p><span class="highlight">Theme:</span> Grandmaster Games, Detailed analysis</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Owner's Remarks:</span>  The book captures the contrast between the positional profundity of Smyslov and the explosive creativity of Tal, the methodical rigor of Botvinnik, and the scientific spirit of Euwe. Kasparov not only presents annotated games but provides a vivid narrative of chess history through the lenses of these great minds, making the book a remarkable fusion of analysis and storytelling.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">RECOMMENDED USE:</span> Use a physical chessboard to play through each annotated game. After every 2–3 moves, pause and reflect:

      <p><span class="highlight">Owner's Remarks:</span>  Petrosian’s impenetrable defense and prophylactic genius are contrasted with Spassky’s universal, dynamic style. Through deeply annotated games, Kasparov not only provides top-level analysis but also explores the philosophical shifts and psychological battles that shaped the Cold War-era chess scene.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">RECOMMENDED USE:</span> Use a physical chessboard to follow along with the games. After every 2–3 moves, pause and reflect:

Why was this move played?

What could have been played instead?

How does this move shape the future structure of the game?

What does this position tell us about the player’s style?

This thoughtful engagement will sharpen your appreciation for both positional and dynamic chess while giving historical depth to your understanding of the world championship lineage.</p>

      <p><span class="highlight">Rating:</span> 800-2200+</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Theme:</span> Endgame</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Owner's Remarks:</span>  Rather than overwhelming the reader with dense theory, Silman organizes material by rating level—from beginner to master—ensuring that each player learns only what is essential at their current stage. 
        His conversational tone and real-world examples make even complex endings feel intuitive.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">RECOMMENDED USE:</span> Study one section appropriate to your rating and make sure you can explain the ideas without the board. Then:

Set up the positions on a physical board.

Try solving them without looking at the solution.

After solving, review Silman’s commentary and compare your thinking.

Revisit tough endings after a few days to test retention.
Use this book in tandem with practical play—online rapid games or endgame drills—to reinforce your technique</p>

      <p><span class="highlight">Owner's Remarks:</span>  This is not just another tactics book—it’s a masterclass in how to think. GM Ramesh doesn’t just throw puzzles at the reader; he walks you through structured thinking, teaches how to build candidate moves, eliminate noise, and visualize clearly.
        Ideal for serious improvers who are ready to refine the mental processes behind accurate calculation. A must-have for tournament players aiming to reduce blunders and develop deep thinking habits.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">RECOMMENDED USE:</span> Work through the book slowly—don’t rush. Spend 10–15 minutes per position if needed.

Maintain a notebook: write down your candidate moves, analysis, and compare with the solution.

Revisit hard positions after a week to reinforce long-term calculation memory.

Pair this book with solving OTB-style puzzles or doing slow, untimed games to fully apply the methods.

Best used with a physical board to train visualization and avoid screen habits.</p>
